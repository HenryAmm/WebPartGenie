Cobuild SharePoint pages and web parts with AI. Web Part Genie is an experimental SharePoint web part that leverages generative AI to create JSX-based web parts from simple text prompts. This enables rapid prototyping, wireframing, and potentially hyper-personalized intranet experiencesâ€”all without requiring coding expertise.  

## How It Works
1. Download the SharePoint package

2. Open SharePoint admin centre, go to More features â†’ Apps and then drag-and-drop the `sppkg` file into your Apps list. Enable the app and it to all pages during the installation.
